# MultiModal-Image-Captioning
This is a Torch implementation of Image Captioning using Multi-modal RNN that use both Word Embeddings and CNN features, as described in [Mao et. al.](http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6632)


The implementation is incomplete and work in progress

Meanwhile check out the Tensorflow Implemetaion by J.Mao [here](https://github.com/mjhucla/TF-mRNN)
